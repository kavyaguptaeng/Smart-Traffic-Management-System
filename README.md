# Smart-Traffic-Management-System
Created a Smart traffic light system to fight congestion by identifying the 2 lanes problems in India using Python and it's libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, collections etc. and put step forward in AI &amp; ML Technology and showcased with help of IOT components like LED's and Arduino UNO.

#I am glad to tell you all that #NIETIDEAS2023, #Tech based Project Exhibition was organised by #AIML Department of our college in which around 190+ Teams registered and showcased their projects.
I was also one of the participant in the same and came as #top11 finalist in the contest.
We created #AI based Smart Traffic light system to fight the daily congestion on the roads.
We had also used #IOT devices like Arduino UNO, LEDs etc. for the better showcase and application.
I would like to thank my wonderful teammate Arpit Rai for giving his equal efforts and dedication to the project.

# Intelligent Traffic Light System

This repository contains the code for an intelligent traffic light system implemented in Python using computer vision techniques and deep learning. The system is capable of detecting and tracking vehicles in a traffic scene, counting the number of vehicles passing through different lanes, and controlling traffic lights accordingly.

## Features

- Real-time vehicle detection and tracking using YOLOv3 object detection model.
- Vehicle counting for different lanes based on their direction of travel.
- Support for both real-time video input and static image analysis.
- Data logging to CSV files for analyzing traffic patterns and trends.
- Optimized for GPU acceleration using CUDA for faster processing.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** OpenCV, NumPy, CUDA
- **Deep Learning Framework:** Darknet (YOLOv3)
- **Other Tools:** CSV for data logging

## Installation
