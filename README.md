# Smart-Traffic-Management-System
Created a Smart traffic light system to fight congestion by identifying the 2 lanes problems in India using Python and it's libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, collections etc. and put step forward in AI &amp; ML Technology and showcased with help of IOT components like LED's and Arduino UNO.

#I am glad to tell you all that #NIETIDEAS2023, #Tech based Project Exhibition was organised by #AIML Department of our college in which around 190+ Teams registered and showcased their projects.
I was also one of the participant in the same and came as #top11 finalist in the contest.
We created #AI based Smart Traffic light system to fight the daily congestion on the roads.
We had also used #IOT devices like Arduino UNO, LEDs etc. for the better showcase and application.
I would like to thank my wonderful teammate Arpit Rai for giving his equal efforts and dedication to the project.
